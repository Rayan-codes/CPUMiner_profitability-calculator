# CPUMiner_hashrate-calculator
CPUMiner Profitability Calculator is a tool that analyses CPU mining performance across different coins from the bat files provided and then It retrieves Hash rates from various miners, fetches real-time coin prices and rewards from multiple APIs, and calculates potential earnings. This helps users estimate profitability without wasting time. 

as you know cpu mining is now not posible on high market cap cryptocurrencies like bitcoin,litecoin
and if you dont have a powerfull enough cpu monero. this tool contains micro cap cryptos that are somewhat 
feaseble to mine with somewhat reasonable hardware from small minepools like https://rplant.xyz however it 
can be used on any set of bat files without much configurations



#How to use
1. Place the .exe file to the folder it is intended on being used 
2. launch and it will create a hashrates text file that has all the hashrates of your files


#How it works
1.the minertest.cpp file first retrieves names of all the bat files from the folder it is placed in and stores them in a text file
2.Then it iterativily runs through all of the bat files taking input from user on how much time to run the bat files(use more time for better results)
3.it records the hashrates in a seperate text file "hashrates"
 
4.check any hashrate to profit calculator
